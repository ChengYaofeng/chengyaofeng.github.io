# Biography

Yaofeng Cheng is a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Mechatronics Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology and the State Key Laboratory of Robotics. He received his B.Eng. degree from the School of Mechatronics Engineering at Wuhan University of Technology. He was sponsored by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to conduct a one-year research exchange at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom.

His research focuses on transparent object perception and robotic manipulation, including depth recovery for transparent objects, point-cloud–based 3D shape estimation, 6-DoF grasp generation guided by spatial geometry, and task-oriented grasping. He has also worked on neural network model pruning. His current research interests include transparent object manipulation, sparse algorithms for large models, and vision-language-action (VLA) systems.
